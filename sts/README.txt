Security Token Service
----------------------

Security Token Services are defined formally within the OASIS WS-Trust specification. They help immensely in
decoupling authentication and authorization maintenance from the web service clients and providers that need that
information. Using the STS eliminates the need for the Web Service Provider (WSP) and Web Service Clients (WSC)
to have a direct trust relationship, freeing WSPs from needing to maintain WSC UsernameToken passwords or X509
certificates from acceptable clients. Instead, it is just necessary for the WSP to trust the STS and for the STS 
to be able to validate the WSC's credentials prior to making the STS call.

For more information, please find in STSUserGuide document.
