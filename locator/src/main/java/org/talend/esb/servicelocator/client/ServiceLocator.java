/**
 * This is the entry point for clients of the Service Locator. To access the
 * Service Locator clients have to first {@link #connect() connect} to the
 * Service Locator to get a session assigned at the server. Once the connection
 * is established the client will periodically send heart beats to the server to
 * keep the session alive. The session gets invalidated if the client is
 * destroyed, disconnected, or fails to successfully send the heart beat for a
 * period of time defined by the {@link #setSessionTimeout(int) session timeout
 * parameter}.
 * <p>
 * The Service Locator provides the following operations.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Register an endpoint for a specific service. If registered as non
 * persistent an endpoint is marked live as long as the session of this client
 * is alive or it is explicitly unregistered. If registered as persistent the
 * endpoint is marked live until the endpoint is explicitly unregistered.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Unregister an endpoint for a specific service. The endpoint is marked as
 * non live, but still in the list of all endpoints for a service.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Remove an endpoint for a specific service. The endpoint is removed from
 * the list of endpoints for the given service.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Look up all live endpoints for a specific service that were registered
 * before by other clients.</li>
 * 
 * <li>All services for which an endpoint was ever registered can be retrieved.</li>
 * 
 * <li>For a specific service all endpoints that were ever registered can be
 * retrieved whether they are currently live or not.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * To ensure that all available endpoints are re-registered when the client
 * reconnects after a session expired a {@link PostConnectAction} should be
 * {@link #setPostConnectAction(PostConnectAction) set} that registers all
 * endpoints again and so marks them as live.
