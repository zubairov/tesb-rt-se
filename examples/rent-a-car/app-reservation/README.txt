Rent-a-Car Description Example 
=======================================

rent-a-car/app-reservation: Rental Client provides the basic functionality to search for the available cars within a given time period.

Use Case Scenario to Rent a Car
-------------------------------
1.A customer enters prerequisite data into a form such as her name, the pick-up and return dates, the preferred type of rental rates, and submits her query. 
2.Next, the application calls the CRMService to retrieve the customer data and customer status information. 
3.The customer is presented with a list of the available cars and selects one from the presented list of results. 
4.Finally, the application calls the ReservationService to submit the reservation request and then displays a reservation confirmation notice to the customer. 

Running app-reservation 
-----------------------
Start CRMService and ReservationService as it described in 
../crmservice/README.txt and ../reservationservice/README.txt

From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is located), the maven pom.xml file can be used to build and run the demo. 
Using either UNIX or Windows:

mvn clean install                 (for basic app-reservation)
mvn clean install -Plocator       (for Service Locator enabled app-reservation)
mvn clean install -Psam           (for Service Activity Monitoring enabled app-reservation)
mvn clean install -Psts           (for Security Token Service enabled app-reservation)

Running this command will build the demo and create an OSGi bundle for deploying the service to OSGi containers.

The OSGi bundle will be created:
app-basic/target/app-reservation-4.0.jar            (for basic app-reservation)
app-locator/target/app-reservation-locator-4.0.jar  (for Service Locator enabled app-reservation)
app-sam/target/app-reservation-sam-4.0.jar          (for Service Activity Monitoring enabled app-reservation)
app-sts/target/app-reservation-sts-4.0.jar          (for Security Token Service enabled app-reservation)

Starting the application
------------------------

1.Start OSGi console
2.Copy app-reservation-4.0.jar (or app-reservation-locator-4.0.jar, app-reservation-sam-4.0.jar, app-reservation-sts-4.0.jar)
  into folder <Talend ESB Runtime>/container/deploy.

In console you will see:
